<retaildir> is No One Lives Forever 2 (Europe) with the English 1.3 update,
as the rez/ submodule installs it (rez/install-games.sh nolf2-eu-1.3:
rez/games/nolf2-eu-1.3/, see build/retail.sh). It is only read: nothing in it
is run, and the build never writes to it.

`resources` is build/all.sh's first step. It copies the game's data: the
.rez archives, the movies, and the shipped autoexec.cfg and default player
profile (as autoexec.cfg.retail and Default.prf.retail, which build/all.sh
starts a game directory's autoexec.cfg and Profiles/Default.prf from, and
build/package.sh packages: the game rewrites both). A movie or an archive
that holds no binary is hard-linked rather than copied when it can be (the
same filesystem): it is the retail file unchanged, and four game
directories would otherwise take 7 GB. Nothing writes to it; were it
changed, build/retail.sh's check of the retail game would say so. No file is
copied that is a Windows executable image (recognised by its "MZ" header,
not its name). Two archives carry the retail game DLLs -- GAMEDLL.REZ the
1.0 ones and Update_v1x3.rez the 1.3 ones (CSHELL.dll, OBJECT.lto,
CLIENTFX.fxd, CRES.dll, SRES.dll) -- and those entries are overwritten with
zeros in our copy: the archive stays valid, the binary is gone, and the only
game code in the directory is what we compiled (in the custom/ rez
directory, last in the rez stack: build/nolf2cmds.sh). The setup's other
files (the Sierra updater, web links) are not copied.

`thirdparty` copies the licensed middleware we have no source for: Bink
(binkw32.dll), and the Microsoft C, C++ and MFC runtime DLLs setup installs
(MFC42.DLL, MFC42U.DLL, MSVCP60.DLL, Msvcrt.dll), which the engine and the
launcher import. With "open" (the modern build, NOLF2_MIDDLEWARE=open) it
leaves out what `openruntime` replaces.

`openruntime` is the modern build's other half of step 2: our Bink player,
binkw32.dll, which build/ext.sh built from src/modern/binkw32/ and
ext/ffmpeg into <extdir>, in place of RAD's (MANIFEST.txt origin `EXT`).
The Microsoft runtime DLLs stay the retail ones in both builds.

No engine binary is copied: Lithtech.exe, server.dll, snddrv.dll,
ServerDir.dll and ltmsg.dll are built from our source (src/Engine/,
src/Game/Libs/ServerDir/) and build/all.sh assembles them.

`reference` copies the retail engine images, launcher and dedicated server,
and the 1.3 game DLLs out of Update_v1x3.rez, to a reference directory
(build/reference.sh: out/reference/). They are what tools/progress.py and
the reconstruction tools compare our objects against; the build never reads
them, and nothing in that directory is ever run or goes into a game
directory.

Every file the steps write is recorded in <gamedir>/MANIFEST.txt
(`<origin>\\t<path>`); build/all.sh adds the binaries it built, and `audit`
lists every PE file in the directory with its origin, failing on any that
is neither built here, nor third-party runtime, nor the modern build's
open-source replacement (EXT) -- or on any PE file still
inside a .rez archive.

`art` reads resources out of one retail image (<image>, its path in the
retail install) and writes them into <resdir> as the files a resource
script compiles back into the same resources: `icon` an RT_GROUP_ICON and
its RT_ICON images as an .ico, `cursor` an RT_GROUP_CURSOR and its
RT_CURSOR images as a .cur, `bitmap` an RT_BITMAP as a .bmp, and `raw:<type>`
any other resource's data as it is. <id> is the group's (or resource's)
number or name. The .ico/.cur lists the images in the group's order, with
the group entry's fields, so rc.exe gives each image the same place, numbered
in that order (it numbers icon and cursor images from 1 up, in the order the
script names them, across all of its icons and cursors). For art that is
the retail game's and not ours to commit: the build writes it, the
repository ignores it. A file already right is left untouched, so a
rebuild sees no change. E.g. an engine's icon:
  art <retaildir> Lithtech.exe src/.../res lithtech.ico=icon:128
